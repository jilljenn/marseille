# Marseille

## Vieux-Port + Fort Saint-Jean

Fort Saint-Jean is part of MUCEM; this fort has free entrance and has an amazing view on Vieux-Port.

## Le Panier / Les Accoules

Old city, full of beautiful street art. Better to go during the day than at night, I guess.

## Ferry "Navette": Vieux-Port to Pointe Rouge / Campagne Pastr√© / Marseilleveyre

It is so cool to take the ferry with a metro ticket.

Campagne Pastr√© is directly connected to National Park of Calanques, so it is possible, although rare, to meet boars. If you encounter one, please tell security? üòÖ There are kids around.

After climbing a few minutes (Marseilleveyre), you will have an impressive view over Marseille. Will post pictures soon.

## Ferry "Bateau": Vieux-Port to Frioul island

No need to go to Ch√¢teau d'If. Directly go to Frioul. There is a Calanque Saint-Est√®ve which is beautiful.

## Calanque Sugiton

Looks like Porco Rosso (again, I will post pictures). However, it is so popular that you have to book it in advance online. A national park!

Other Calanques: Sormiou, Morgiou, Sam√©na, etc.

## Catholic stuff

- Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde (by bus)
- Abbaye Saint-Victor (5th century)

## Eat

- Four des Navettes
- Fish soup / Fresh fish on Vieux-Port
- A√Øoli
- Panisses
- Actually any Mediterranean food is great (Aubagne street you have all of them: Tunisian chez Yassine; Moroccan at F√©mina; Greek)

## Other recommendations

Eat at Goudes / Anse de la maronaise (the water is not that great but close to it you can have a view over Ma√Øre island).
